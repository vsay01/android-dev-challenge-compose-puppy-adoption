Now that her pups are adopted and in wonderful homes, it is her turn. She is not going to be a super easy dog at first but we guarantee that all the love you put into her will be given back tenfold."

He will test boundaries but once he realizes that you mean business he will listen and follow your lead and even becomes the puppy he is. Mars will require a strong handed and minded owner. Someone with husky experience would best understand this fella. With time and patience Mars will be a faithful and lovable dog."
